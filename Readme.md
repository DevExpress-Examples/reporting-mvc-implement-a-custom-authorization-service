# Reporting for MVC - How to Implement a Custom Authorization Service

This example illustrates how to restrict access to specific reports and documents based on an ASP.NET session, making documents available only to users that generated them. To do this, register anÂ `OperationLogger` object implementing theÂ IWebDocumentViewerAuthorizationService interface and is inherited from the base [WebDocumentViewerOperationLogger](https://documentation.devexpress.com/#XtraReports/clsDevExpressXtraReportsWebWebDocumentViewerWebDocumentViewerOperationLoggertopic)Â class.
